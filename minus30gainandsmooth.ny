; Create a sound to apply the effects to
(setq my-sound (s-rest 1)) ; This is just a placeholder for your actual sound

; Decrease volume by 30% (scale the sound by 0.7)
(setq quieter-sound (scale 0.7 my-sound))

; Apply a low-pass filter to make the sound more gentle and smooth
; The second argument is the cutoff frequency, adjust it as needed (e.g., 1000 Hz)
(setq smoothed-sound (lowpass quieter-sound 1000))

; Play the resulting sound
